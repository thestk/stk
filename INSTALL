The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK)

By Perry R. Cook and Gary P. Scavone, 1995-2005.

The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ can be used in a variety of ways, depending on your particular needs.  Some people just choose the classes they need for a particular project and copy those to their project directory.  Others like to compile and link to a library of object files.  STK was not designed with one particular style of use in mind.

To configure and compile (on Unix systems):

1. Unpack the STK distribution (tar -xzf stk-4.x.x.tar.gz).
2. From within the directory containing this file, run configure:

   ./configure

3. From within each project directory, type "make".
4. To compile a library of objects, type "make" from within the src directory.

Several options can be passed to configure, including:

  --disable-realtime = only compile generic non-realtime classes
  --enable-debug = enable various debug output
  --with-alsa = choose native ALSA API support (default, linux only)
  --with-jack = choose native JACK server API support (linux only)
  --with-oss = choose native OSS API support (linux only)

It is now possible to specify more than one Linux audio API.  Note however that the ALSA library is required in order to compile the RtMidi class, even if the "--with-oss" option is provided (only the OSS audio API will be used, not the OSS MIDI API).  Typing "./configure --help" will display all the available options.  In addition, it is possible to specify the RAWWAVES and INCLUDE paths to configure as (ex. to set to /home/gary/rawwaves and /home/gary/include):

  ./configure RAWWAVE_PATH='$(HOME)/rawwaves/'
  ./configure INCLUDE_PATH='$(HOME)/include/'

The ending "/" is required for the RAWWAVES path.  The default behavior will set a relative path that works for the project files included with the distribution (assuming they are not moved).  You can also change the RAWWAVE_PATH dynamically via the static Stk::setRawwavePath() function.

If you wish to use a different compiler than that selected by configure, specify that compiler in the command line (ex. to use CC):

  ./configure CXX=CC

In addition, a linux RPM is available from the Planet CCRMA WWW site (http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/).


For Windows Users:

An STK distribution is available which contains precompiled executables.  In addition, Visual C++ project files are included for each of the example STK projects.
