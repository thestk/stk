OVERVIEW:

The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK) is a set of audio signal processing and synthesis classes and algorithms written in C++.  You can use these classes to create programs that make sounds with a variety of synthesis techniques.  This is not a terribly novel concept, except that the Synthesis ToolKit is extremely portable (it's mostly platform-independent C and C++ code), and it's completely user-extensible (no libraries, no hidden drivers, and all source code is included).  We like to think that this increases the chances that our programs will still work in another 5-10 years.  In fact, the ToolKit has been working continuously for nearly 8 years now.  STK currently runs with "realtime" support (audio and MIDI) on SGI (Irix), Linux, and Windows computer platforms.  Generic, non-realtime support has been tested under NeXTStep, Sun, and other platforms and should work with any standard C++ compiler.

The Synthesis ToolKit is free for non-commercial use.  The only parts of the Synthesis ToolKit that are platform-dependent concern real-time audio and MIDI input and output, and that is taken care of with a few special classes.  The interface for MIDI input and the simple <A HREF="http://dev.scriptics.com">Tcl/Tk</A> graphical user interfaces (GUIs) provided is the same, so it's easy to experiment in real time using either the GUIs or MIDI.  The Synthesis ToolKit can generate simultaneous SND (AU), WAV, AIFF, and MAT-file output soundfile formats (as well as realtime sound output), so you can view your results using one of a large variety of sound/signal analysis tools already available (e.g. <A HREF="http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/">Snd</A>, Cool Edit, Matlab). 

The Synthesis Toolkit is not one particular program.  Rather, it is a set of C++ classes that you can use to create your own programs.  A few example applications are provided to demonstrate some of the ways to use the classes.  If you have specific needs, you will probably have to either modify the example programs or write a new program altogether. Further, the example programs don't have a fancy GUI wrapper. If you feel the need to have a "drag and drop" graphical patching GUI, you probably don't want to use the ToolKit. Spending hundreds of hours making platform-dependent graphics code would go against one of the fundamental design goals of the ToolKit - platform independence. 

For those instances where a simple GUI with sliders and buttons is helpful, we use <A HREF="http://dev.scriptics.com">Tcl/Tk</A> (which is freely distributed for all the supported ToolKit platforms). A number of Tcl/Tk GUI scripts are distributed with the ToolKit release.  For control, the Synthesis Toolkit uses raw MIDI (on supported platforms), and SKINI (Synthesis ToolKit Instrument Network Interface, a MIDI-like text message synthesis control format).


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

See the individual README's (eg. README-linux) for platform specific information and system requirements.  In general, you will use either the provided Makefiles (Unix platforms) or the VC++ workspace files to compile the example programs.  To use the Tcl/Tk GUIs, you will need Tcl/Tk version 8.0 or higher.


WHAT'S NEW:

STK has undergone several key revisions, changes, and additions since its last release.  Despite being available in one form or another since 1996, we still consider STK to be alpha software.  Thus, backward compatability has not been a priority.  Please read the Release Notes to see what has changed since the last release.

The control message handling scheme has been simplified greatly through the use of the Messager class.  It is now possible to have access to simultaneous piped, socketed, and/or MIDI input control messages.  In most cases, this should eliminate the use of the Md2Skini program.

Realtime audio input capabilities were added to STK with release 3.0, though the behavior of such is very hardware dependent.  Under Linux and Irix, audio input and output are possible with very low latency.  Using the Windoze DirectSound API, minimum dependable output sound latency seems to be around 20 milliseconds or so, while input sound latency is on the order of a hundred milliseconds or more!

As mentioned above, it is possible to record the audio ouput of an STK program to .snd, .wav, .raw, .aif, and .mat (Matlab MAT-file) output file types.  Though somewhat obsolete, the program Md2Skini can be used to write SKINI scorefiles from realtime MIDI input.  Finally, STK should compile with non-realtime functionality on any platform with a generic C++ compiler.

For those who wish to make a library from the core STK classes, there is a Makefile in the src directory that will accomplish that (Linux and SGI only).


DISCLAIMER:

You probably already guessed this, but just to be sure, we don't guarantee anything works.  :-)  It's free ... what do you expect?  If you find a bug, please let us know and we'll try to correct it.  You can also make suggestions, but again, no guarantees.  Send email to prc@cs.princeton.edu and gary@ccrma.stanford.edu. 


LEGAL AND ETHICAL:

This software was designed and created to be made publicly available for free, primarily for academic purposes, so if you use it, pass it on with this documentation, and for free.  

If you make a million dollars with it, give us some.  If you make compositions with it, put us in the program notes.

Some of the concepts are covered by various patents, some known to us and likely others which are unknown.  Many of the ones known to us are administered by the Stanford Office of Technology and Licensing.  

The good news is that large hunks of the techniques used here are public domain.  To avoid subtle legal issues, we'll not state what's freely useable here, but we'll try to note within the various classes where certain things are likely to be protected by patents.

PERRY'S NOTES FROM THE ORIGINAL DISTRIBUTION:

This whole world was created with no particular hardware in mind.  These examples are intended to be tutorial in nature, as a platform for the continuation of my research, and as a possible starting point for a software synthesis system.  The basic motivation was to create the necessary unit generators to do the synthesis, processing, and control that I want to do and teach about.  Little thought for optimization was given (see Object.cpp), and therefore improvements, especially speed enhancements, should be possible with these classes.  It was written with some basic concepts in mind about how to let compilers optimize.

Your question at this point might be, "But Perry, with CMix, CMusic, CSound, CShells, CMonkeys, etc. already cluttering the landscape, why a new set of stupid C functions for music synthesis and processing?"  The answers lie below.

1) I needed to port many of the things I've done
   into something which is generic enough to port
   further to different machines.

2) I really plan to document this stuff, so that
   you don't have to be me to figure out what's 
   going on. (I'll probably be sorry I said this 
   in a couple of years, when even I can't figure
   out what I was thinking.)

3) The classic difficulties most people have in 
   trying to implement physical models are:

   A) They have trouble understanding the papers, 
      and/or in turning the theory into practice.

   B) The Physical Model instruments are a pain to get 
      to oscillate, and coming up with stable and 
      meaningful parameter values is required to 
      get the models to work at all.

   This set of C++ unit generators and instruments
   might help to diminish the scores of emails I
   get asking what to do with those block diagrams
   I put in my papers.

4) I wanted to try some new stuff with modal synthesis, 
   and implement some classic FM patches as well.

5) I wanted to reimplement, and newly implement
   more of the intelligent and physical performer
   models I've talked about in some of my papers.
   But I wanted to do it in a portable way, and in 
   such a way that I can hook up modules quickly.
   I also wanted to make these instruments connectable
   to such player objects, so folks like Brad Garton
   who really think a lot about the players can connect
   them to my instruments, a lot about which I think.

6) More rationalizations to follow . . .
