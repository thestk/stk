<h2><a class="anchor" id="license">
Does STK have a license?</a></h2>
<p>Yes, we finally made something official for release 4.3.0. It is listed in the Stk class and a few other places in the distribution, but I'll repeat it here for clarity:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK) is a set of open source audio
signal processing and algorithmic synthesis classes written in the
C++ programming language. STK was designed to facilitate rapid
development of music synthesis and audio processing software, with
an emphasis on cross-platform functionality, realtime control,
ease of use, and educational example code.  STK currently runs
with realtime support (audio and MIDI) on Linux, Macintosh OS X,
and Windows computer platforms. Generic, non-realtime support has
been tested under NeXTStep, Sun, and other platforms and should
work with any standard C++ compiler.

</pre></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="filerate">
Why is my file sample rate wrong?</a></h2>
<p>When the FileWvIn class loads a soundfile, it automatically sets its internal read increment based on the soundfile rate and the current STK sample rate. For example, if the current STK sample rate is 44100 Hz and the soundfile rate is 22050 Hz, the read increment, or rate, will be set to 0.5 and the file will be interpolated so that is sounds correct at 44100 Hz. For most cases, this works fine. However, consider the following example:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">FileWvIn input( <span class="stringliteral">&quot;infile&quot;</span> );                 <span class="comment">// read an input soundfile</span>
StkFloat sampleRate = input.getFileRate();
Stk::setSampleRate( sampleRate );           <span class="comment">// set a new STK sample rate based on the file rate</span>
</pre></div><p>With version 4.3 and higher of STK, the FileWvIn class will be notified of a sample rate change and it will automatically adjust its read rate accordingly. Previous versions of STK did not perform this change and thus, the read rate could end up being incorrect. If you do not want FileWvIn to perform this automatic adjustment, you can call the <code>ignoreSampleRateChange()</code> function for a given class instance.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="endianness">
Why does the sound I generated with STK sound like *&amp;#@!?</a></h2>
<p>If the resultant sound generated by an STK program sounds like noise (and you're not doing an MLS experiment), the problem is likely related to the byte "endianness" of your computer. By default, STK assumes "big endian" byte order. If you are working with STK classes on a PC (Windows or Linux), you <em>must</em> define the <code>__LITTLE_ENDIAN__</code> preprocessor definition <em>before</em> compiling. If after reading this you realize you need to make this change, do not forget to recompile all STK classes from scratch.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="xwindows">
Why do I get a Tk display error message?</a></h2>
<p>The following error may be printed to your terminal window (depending on the version of the tcl/tk interpreter you are running) if you attempt to start an STK tcl/tk interface without the X Server first running:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">Application initialization failed: <span class="keyword">this</span> isn<span class="stringliteral">&#39;t a Tk applicationcouldn&#39;</span>t connect to display <span class="stringliteral">&quot;:0.0&quot;</span>
</pre></div><p>Simply start your X server and then try the command again. </p>
