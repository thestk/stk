/*! \page realtime Realtime Audio (blocking)

In this section, we modify the <TT>sineosc.cpp</TT> program in order
to send the output to the default audio playback device on your
computer system.  We also make use of the SineWave class as a
sine-wave oscillator.  SineWave computes an internal, static sine-wave
table when its first instance is created.  Subsequent instances make
use of the same table.  The default table length, specified in
SineWave.h, is 2048 samples.

\include rtsine.cpp

The class RtWvOut is a protected subclass of WvOut.  A number of
optional constructor arguments can be used to fine tune its
performance for a given system.  RtWvOut provides a "single-sample",
blocking interface to the RtAudio class.  Note that RtWvOut (as well
as the RtWvIn class described below) makes use of RtAudio's callback
input/output functionality by creating a large ring-buffer into which
data is written.  These classes should not be used when low-latency
and robust performance is necessary

Though not used here, an RtWvIn class exists as well that can be used
to read realtime audio data from an input device.  See the
<TT>record.cpp</TT> example program in the <TT>examples</TT> project
for more information.

It may be possible to use an instance of RtWvOut and an instance of
RtWvIn to simultaneously read and write realtime audio to and from a
hardware device or devices.  However, it is recommended to instead use
a single instance of RtAudio to achieve this behavior, as described in the next section.
See the <TT>effects</TT> project or the <TT>duplex.cpp</TT> example
program in the <TT>examples</TT> project for more information.

When using any realtime STK class (RtAudio, RtWvOut, RtWvIn, RtDuplex, RtMidi, InetWvIn, InetWvOut, Socket, UdpSocket, TcpServer, TcpClient, and Thread), it is necessary to specify an audio/MIDI API preprocessor definition and link with the appropriate libraries or frameworks.  For example, the above program could be compiled on a Linux system using the GNU g++ compiler and the ALSA audio API as follows (assuming all necessary files exist in the project directory):

\code
g++ -Wall -D__LINUX_ALSA__ -D__LITTLE_ENDIAN__ -o rtsine Stk.cpp Generator.cpp SineWave.cpp WvOut.cpp \
    RtWvOut.cpp RtAudio.cpp rtsine.cpp -lpthread -lasound
\endcode

On a Macintosh OS X system, the syntax would be:

\code
g++ -Wall -D__MACOSX_CORE__ -o rtsine Stk.cpp Generator.cpp SineWave.cpp WvOut.cpp RtWvOut.cpp RtAudio.cpp \
   rtsine.cpp -lpthread -framework CoreAudio -framework CoreMIDI -framework CoreFoundation
\endcode
