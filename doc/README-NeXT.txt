The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK)

By Perry R. Cook and Gary P. Scavone, 1995-2004.

Please read the file README and INSTALL for more general STK information.

STK has always worked under NeXTStep without realtime audio or MIDI support.  In general, STK should compile in this way using any generic C++ compiler.  C++ exception handling was added to STK with release 3.2.  We managed to get a version of gcc compiled for NeXTStep that can deal with C++ exceptions.
